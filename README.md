### Notes
In the early stage of building the new features, I accidentaly clicked on some ticking box on the right-side column of XCode, and after that my app could not open the movie detail page anymore. I could not figure out how my action caused the bug and how to fix it, so I reverted my app back to my Lab 1 commit ("Homepage finished") and started again from there. This app's UI only looks decent on iPhone 8 currently.

### Notes
It was a smooth process in general, but I still need to always keep in mind that I should not assign values to parameters of a 
UI object that I haven't linked to the code portion
